    name: "Everest",
    description:
      "Mount Everest is Earth's highest mountain above sea level, located in the Mahalangur Himal sub-range of the Himalayas. The China–Nepal border runs across its summit point. Its elevation (snow height) of 8,848.86 m was most recently established in 2020 by the Chinese and Nepali authorities. Mount Everest attracts many climbers, including highly experienced mountaineers. There are two main climbing routes, one approaching the summit from the southeast in Nepal and the other from the north in Tibet. While not posing substantial technical climbing challenges on the standard route, Everest presents dangers such as altitude sickness, weather, and wind, as well as hazards from avalanches and the Khumbu Icefall. As of November 2022, 310 people have died on Everest. Over 200 bodies remain on the mountain and have not been removed due to the dangerous conditions",

      "K2, at 8,611 metres  above sea level, is the second-highest mountain on Earth, after Mount Everest at 8,849 metres. It lies in the Karakoram range, partially in the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan-administered Kashmir and partially in the China-administered Trans-Karakoram Tract in the Taxkorgan Tajik Autonomous County of Xinjiang.K2 also became popularly known as the Savage Mountain after George Bell—a climber on the 1953 American expedition—told reporters, It's a savage mountain that tries to kill you. Of the five highest mountains in the world, K2 is the deadliest; approximately one person dies on the mountain for every four who reach the summit. Also occasionally known as Mount Godwin-Austen, other nicknames for K2 are The King of Mountains and The Mountaineers' Mountain, as well as The Mountain of Mountains after prominent Italian climber Reinhold Messner titled his book about K2 the same",

    description:
      "Kangchenjunga, also spelled Kanchenjunga, Kanchanjanghā and Khangchendzonga, is the third-highest mountain in the world. Its summit lies at 8,586 m  in a section of the Himalayas, the Kangchenjunga Himal, which is bounded in the west by the Tamur River, in the north by the Lhonak River and Jongsang La, and in the east by the Teesta River. It lies in the border region between Nepal and Mangan district, Sikkim state of India, with three of the five peaks, namely Main, Central and South, directly on the border, and the peaks West and Kangbachen in Nepal's Taplejung District. Until 1852, Kangchenjunga was assumed to be the highest mountain in the world, but calculations and measurements by the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India in 1849 showed that Mount Everest, known as Peak XV at the time, is actually higher. After allowing for further verification of all calculations, it was officially announced in 1856 that Kangchenjunga was the third-highest mountain.",

      "Lhotse is the fourth highest mountain in the world at 8,516 metres, after Mount Everest, K2, and Kangchenjunga. The main summit is on the border between Tibet Autonomous Region of China and the Khumbu region of Nepal. With Everest to the north and Nuptse to the west, Lhotse forms the apex of the massive horseshoe-shaped arc of the Everest massif. Despite the tremendous vertical relief of its South and Northeast Faces, it is the least prominent of the eight-thousanders due to the great height of the South Col between it and Everest. Lhotse's Western Face, recessed behind the head of the Khumbu Glacier in the Western Cwm, plays an integral part in the standard routes of ascent for both peaks; the name Lhotse, which means South Peak in Tibetan, further emphasizes the close relationship between the two.",

One of the eight-thousanders, Makalu is an isolated peak in the shape of a four-sided pyramid. Makalu has two notable subsidiary peaks. Kangchungtse, or Makalu II  lies about three kilometres (two miles) north-northwest of the main summit. Rising about 5 km north-northeast of the main summit across a broad plateau, and connected to Kangchungtse by a narrow, 7,200 m saddle, is Chomo Lonzo.",

      "Mount Fuji is an active stratovolcano located on the Japanese island of Honshū, with a summit elevation of 3,776.24 m. It is the tallest mountain in Japan, the second-highest volcano located on an island in Asia (after Mount Kerinci on the island of Sumatra), and seventh-highest peak of an island on Earth. Mount Fuji last erupted from 1707 to 1708.The mountain is located about 100 km southwest of Tokyo and is visible from the Japanese capital on clear days. Mount Fuji's exceptionally symmetrical cone, which is covered in snow for about five months of the year, is commonly used as a cultural icon of Japan and it is frequently depicted in art and photography, as well as visited by sightseers, hikers and mountain climbers. Mount Fuji is one of Japan's Three Holy Mountains along with Mount Tate and Mount Haku. It is a Special Place of Scenic Beauty and one of Japan's Historic Sites. It was added to the World Heritage List as a Cultural Site on June 22, 2013. According to UNESCO, Mount Fuji has inspired artists and poets and been the object of pilgrimage for centuries. UNESCO recognizes 25 sites of cultural interest within the Mount Fuji locality. These 25 locations include the mountain and the Shinto shrine, Fujisan Hongū Sengen Taisha",

      "Mount Kita is a mountain of the Akaishi Mountains−Southern Alps, in Yamanashi Prefecture, Japan. It is located in the north of the Southern Japan Alps and is the main peak of the Shirane Three mountains (Mt. Kita-dake, Mt. Aino-dake, Mt. Notori-dake). It is the second highest peak in Japan, following Mt. Fuji-yama. When looking from north or south, its shape is a beautiful triangular pyramid.  This mountain is known as the jewel box of alpine plants such as Kita-dake-sou, an endemic spieces. The view of Mt. Fuji above a sea of clouds can be seen at sunset from the summit, which makes you realize that you are at a high elevation. It is said that the mountain was reached for the first time by a rower, Naoe Natori in 1871 . The numbers of hikers increased dramatically after Norokawa logging road was built in 1963. A rocky cliff on the east slope is called Kita-dake buttress and the 600 M vertical cliff drops from the summit to O-kanba sawa stream. Many rock climbers long for the buttress. It is a place, dear to the climber’s heart in the South Japan Alps, where there are quite a few rocky cliff courses.",

      "The Matterhorn is a mountain of the Alps, straddling the main watershed and border between Switzerland and Italy. It is a large, near-symmetric pyramidal peak in the extended Monte Rosa area of the Pennine Alps, whose summit is 4,478 metres high, making it one of the highest summits in the Alps and Europe. The four steep faces, rising above the surrounding glaciers, face the four compass points and are split by the Hörnli, Furggen, Leone/Lion, and Zmutt ridges. The mountain overlooks the Swiss town of Zermatt, in the canton of Valais, to the northeast; and the Italian town of Breuil-Cervinia in the Aosta Valley to the south. Just east of the Matterhorn is Theodul Pass, the main passage between the two valleys on its north and south sides, which has been a trade route since the Roman Era.",

    name: "Vinicunca",
    description:
      "Peru’s pink and yellow-streaked Vinicunca or “Rainbow Mountain” seems to belong on another planet. But it’s part of the Peruvian Andes, right here on Earth. The mountain, whose colours are caused by mineral deposits, is around a three-to-four-hour drive southeast of Cusco, a beautiful city filled with Spanish Colonial buildings. Vinicunca’s summit is reached by the challenging, six-day Ausangate trek. Parts of the trek will be more than 4,800 metres above sea level and the altitude can be a real challenge – drink plenty of water, take regular breaks and carry paracetamol with you. It’s worth it, though, for the otherworldly views and the route’s relative quietness when compared with the tourist-choked Inca Trail to Machu Picchu. Trail conditions are at their best and driest through Peru’s winter months: April–November.",

      "You can find it in north-eastern Tanzania, right in the centre of its namesake national park. The “Roof of Africa” is a fitting nickname for the mountain, which is 5,895m at its highest point. Kilimanjaro is actually a volcano made up of a trio of peaks. Though if you’re planning a trip, you’ll be glad to hear it’s dormant – the last eruption happened some 360,000 years ago. If you dream of standing at Kilimanjaro’s summit, looking out over the clouds, plan your trip for January through to March, or June through to October. The other months of the year bring with them rain and snow. Most trekkers set their sights on the Marangu Route: expect six days’ worth of hiking over the craggy terrain and rest up in mountain huts along the way. If you’re content with seeing the peak from a distance, the Tanzanian town of Moshi is a great vantage point.",

    description:
      "At 1,545 m, this is not the tallest mountain in Australia – but what it lacks in size, it more than makes up for with beauty. Overlooking sapphire Dove Lake, the ridged scarp of Cradle Mountain is quite a sight. It dominates Cradle Mountain-Lake St Clair National Park, snow-freckled in winter, and rising from lush grass and forestland through summer. Excavations of the area around the mountain have unearthed many native sites, but it was English surveyor Joseph Fossey who christened the peak “Cradle Mountain”, because of its curiously curved shape. Now it’s one of Tasmania’s most popular tourist attractions and is around an hour-and-a-half drive from the busy city of Devonport. There are hikes for all abilities throughout the national park. They all reward the walker with awesome views of Cradle Mountain, and also take in glacial lakes, dense woodland and the occasional waterfall along the way.",

      "Banff National Park has plenty of peaks, but Castle Mountain is the most unique. And it’s easy to see how it got its name. The mountain resembles a turreted fortress, perched ominously above the spruce and fir trees in the Canadian Rockies. Head to Castle Junction, where the Banff-Windermere Highway and the Trans-Canada Highway meet in the park. Here you’ll get glorious views of the mountain, especially beautiful in the early morning light. Then, the 6.4-kilometre Castle Mountain Lookout trail (trailhead near Castle Junction) will take you up to a scenic viewpoint on the peak where you can look out across the park. Tackle it in spring, summer or autumn to avoid slippery winter conditions.",
